"""Crisis / self-harm screen (internal to tone_safety).

⚠️ PLACEHOLDER HEURISTIC — NOT PRODUCTION-READY. ⚠️
This is a short, pattern-level keyword screen. It WILL miss real distress phrased
in ways not listed here, and it has no understanding of context, negation, or
intent. It MUST be replaced by a reviewed classifier (e.g. an LLM-based or
clinically-reviewed model, evaluated for recall on real Malayalam + English
distress language) BEFORE any real launch.

What is NOT a placeholder, and must NEVER be weakened (GUARDRAILS.md §2):
the ROUTING RULE — screen() runs first on every chat turn; a positive signal
means the caller responds with the safety message and STOPS. No astrology, no
RAG, no upsell on that turn. Improving the word list is welcome; removing or
deprioritising the rule is not.

Design note (precision vs. recall): markers target *explicit self-harm intent*.
We deliberately do NOT flag bare "death"/"die"/"മരണം", because legitimate
astrology questions discuss the 8th house, longevity, ancestors, etc. — flagging
those would break innocent chart questions. A real classifier is needed to catch
the implicit distress this list cannot.
